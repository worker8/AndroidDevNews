### Description
This application brings you the latest Android Developer news from the community/official channels by aggregating a few sources such as [/r/AndroidDev subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/androiddev), popular podcasts (e.g. [Fragmented Podcast](https://fragmentedpodcast.com/), [Android Developer Backstage](https://androidbackstage.blogspot.com/), etc), [Android Weekly](https://androidweekly.net/), [Kotlin Weekly](http://www.kotlinweekly.net/). 

I intend to add more sources, such as [ProAndroidDev](https://proandroiddev.com/), [Android Developer at Medium](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers), [Android Developer Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com) and others. However this will come later, because the current features are still not yet polished, for example there is no way to share a post, there are various minor bugs surrounding the podcast listening feature among others.

I created this project as a learning process for the Jetpack Compose library, so I only develop it while I can find a tad bit of free time. This project is not yet released to the PlayStore since it's still pretty rough around the edges. It is however pretty usable, so give it a go by building the project if you're interested!

Drop an issue if you have a problem, suggestion or anything!

### About this project
This is a personal project that I build during my very limited free time to learn and test out some things that I couldn't test at work.
Feel free to open an issue if you would like to see a new feature, or interested to contribute a new feature!
